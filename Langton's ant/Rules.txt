RL


You must only type R (for right) or L (for left) in the first line. (There must be at least two letters)
They define the rules of the "ant" when it steps on a color:
For every letter, there is a color. They define whether the ant must go Left or Right upon stepping on it.

I you delete or add something incorrect to the rules, one of six will be chosen at random between RL, LLRR, RLLR, LRRRRRLLR, LLRRRLRLRLLR, RRLLLRLLLRRR, and RRRRL.
