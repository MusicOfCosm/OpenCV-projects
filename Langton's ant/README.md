# Langton's ant

I made this during October 2023, almost a year and a half after the Slime mold project. As with most of my finished projects, I do stuff to give as a gift for family (it motivates me). This time it's no different, but I did have to search for something to do. The first thing I tried was to implement [reaction-diffusion](https://karlsims.com/rd.html), but for the life of me, I couldn't get it to work, whether it was in Python or C++, OpenCV or OpenGL.

I'm not sure where I first heard of Langton's ant, [Numberphile](https://www.youtube.com/@numberphile) maybe? Anyway, I decided to do that instead and it worked, quite well in fact, you can even change the rules that the ant follows.
